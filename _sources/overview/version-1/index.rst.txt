Version 1
=========

PEAK's first version is made of 4 main components:

1. A `Raspberry Pi Pico W <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/get-started-pico-w>`_
2. An OLED display (``ssd1306``)
3. A battery (preferably 3.3V)
4. 6 buttons for navigation (Up, Down, Left, Right, Back and Ok)

More components can be added and applications can be made to support them (for example an NFC reader).
