Build it yourself
=================
Building a PEAK device is very hard and it usually takes more than a year
(Just kidding: just follow everything and you should be fine. This is just for TL:DR people).

.. warning:: 
    This project is not for beginners. You need to know how to solder precisely, and if you "think" that even if you never did it you could still try,
    I'm sorry but it's not like that. Come back when you actually know what you're doing.
